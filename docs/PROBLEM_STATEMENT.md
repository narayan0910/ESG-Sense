# ESG News Analyzer & Sentiment Tracker

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Investors, stakeholders, and conscious consumers struggle to stay informed about companies' ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance. ESG-related news is often scattered across multiple sources, buried in financial reports, or obscured by greenwashing. This fragmentation makes it difficult to:
- Track real-time ESG trends for specific companies.
- Understand the prevailing sentiment (positive/negative) of news coverage.
- Identify critical issues in specific categories (e.g., a sudden spike in Governance controversies).

### The Solution
**ESG News Analyzer** is a central platform that aggregates news, utilizes AI to analyze content, and provides actionable insights.

The platform solves the core problem by:
1. **Aggregating** news for major companies into a single dashboard.
2. **Analyzing** each article using AI to determine:
   - **Sentiment**: Is the news positive, negative, or neutral?
   - **Categorization**: Does it relate to Environmental, Social, or Governance factors?
3. **Visualizing** trends over time, allowing users to see at a glance if a company is improving or deteriorating in its ESG performance.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Automated Intelligence**: Replaces manual news monitoring with AI-driven classification.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**: Converts qualitative news text into quantitative sentiment scores (-1 to +1).
- **Proactive Insights**: Highlights trending issues (e.g., "Labor Strikes" under Social) before they become major crises.

### Target Audience
- **ESG Investors**: Looking for non-financial indicators of risk.
- **Corporate Sustainability Officers**: Monitoring their own company's public perception.
- **Conscious Consumers**: Deciding which brands to support based on ethical practices.
